# GRPC Microservice

This is a gRPC microservice implemented using Java.

## What is gRPC?

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google for building remote procedure call (RPC) systems. It allows you to define services and message types using Protocol Buffers, a language-agnostic binary serialization format. With gRPC, you can easily create efficient and scalable microservices that can communicate with each other over different networks and programming languages.
